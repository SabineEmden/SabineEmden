## Hi there! 👋 I'm Sabine.

**I'm an aspiring web developer and a former chemist.**

What I bring from chemistry to software development is a systematic approach to problem solving and the perseverance to not give up easily.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning full-stack JavaScript with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
- 💪 I'm using [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to practice building websites in a realistic workflow.
- 🔭 I'm building [my personal website](https://www.sabineemden.com/) with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
  
### My technical skills 👩‍💻

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Astro
- Git & GitHub
