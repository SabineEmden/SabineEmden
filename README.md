# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sabine.

**I'm an aspiring web developer and a former chemist.**

What I bring from chemistry to software development is a systematic approach to problem solving and the grit to not give up easily.

- 🌱 **Currently learning:** full-stack JavaScript with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
- 💪 **Additional practice:** building websites in a realistic workflow with [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
- 🔭 **Side project:** building [my personal website](https://www.sabineemden.com/) with [Astro](https://astro.build/)
