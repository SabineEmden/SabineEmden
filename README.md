## Hi there! 👋 I'm Sabine.

I'm an aspiring software developer and a former chemist. What I bring from chemistry to software development is the perseverance to not give up easily and a systematic approach to problem solving.

I'm currently learning full-stack JavaScript with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). As a side project, I'm building my personal website with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### My technical skills 👩‍💻

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Astro
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- Figma
